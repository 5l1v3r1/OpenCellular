Caller: Chrome OS EC main dispatcher

This directory stores *.h files of those functions that partner implements.

The actual implementation (.c files) resides under S*Ware/eclib/, which
is under partner's licensed and wraps S*Ware/drivelib/ chip-specific code.

This directory is under Chromium license so that the main loop can include these
files and call the code implemented by partner.
