# When 1st character of a line is #, this is a comment line which is ignored
# Line format: filename, localpath, remotepath, filecommand, filecmdtimeout
# filename: base filename (if not provided, localpath and remotepath must include full file pathname)
# localpath: local file directory path, relative or absolute, or full path if filename is not provided
# remotepath: remote file directory path, relative or absolute, or full path if filename is not provided
# filecommand: ssh command executed after the file transfer (if not empty)
# filecmdtimeout: if filecommand is provided, force this ssh time out value instead of default
# if filename, localpath and remotepath are all not provided, no scp transfer will occur
# Equivalent operations (default remote file access will be 644 if remote file does not exist):
# scp localpath+filename remotepath+filename
# ssh filecommand
#
# This is a needed file to clean target /mnt/app and recreate it from scratch, send though SCP
# with optionnal SSH command
