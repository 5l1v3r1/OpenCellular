- EC Lib

This wraps Blizzard driverlib and implements the EC chip interface defined
by Google. See below diagram for architecture.

Build Options
=============

- CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HELP

	Try to detect a watchdog that is about to fire, and print a trace.
	This is needed on STM32, where the independent watchdog has no early
	warning feature and the windowed watchdog has a very short period.

- CONFIG_PANIC_NEW_STACK

	When reporting a panic, change to a completely new stack. This might
	help get a useful trace out a situation where the stack or stack
	pointer has been corrupted.
